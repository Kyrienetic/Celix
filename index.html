                <p>
                    Celix is a demon bound to forgotten broadcasts, corrupted signals, and
                    voices that were never meant to last. He exists between frequencies,
                    appearing where static lingers too long.

                <p>
                    Celix can travel through electronic signals, distort sound and vision,
                    and communicate through broken screens, radios, and interference.
                    The longer a signal is ignored, the stronger he becomes.

                    <strong>Vox:</strong> A rival broadcaster operating on visual dominance.

                <p>
                    His sigil resembles a fractured broadcast mark, formed of broken lines
                    and looping interference. It often appears burned into screens or walls
                    near active transmissions.

                <p>
                    Celix does not speak unless acknowledged. Muted devices weaken him,
                    but destroyed ones only spread his signal further.
